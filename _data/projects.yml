    To follow the latest research, I participate in the survey member for top conferences on computer vision and natural language processing.
    Speaking with fellow researchers on computer vision helps me a lot on my research and brainstorming.

    Most natural videos contain numerous events. For example, in a video of a 'man playing a piano', the video might also contain another 'man dancing' or 'a crowd clapping'.
    This challenge studies the task of dense-captioning events, which involves both detecting and describing events in a video.

    I conducted the whole lecture, which includes making the code, preparing the slides and presentation, and teaching students.
    I explained the powers and limits of AI as accurately as possible to beginners without giving high-level mathematics.
